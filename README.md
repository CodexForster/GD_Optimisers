# Introducing Higher Moment Terms in Heavy-Ball Optimisation
In this project, we look forward to introduce higher "moment" terms in Heavy-Ball optimisationStudies on Optimisation Algorithms in Machine Learning and look at how they affect the training process in terms of rate of convergence, probability of convergence, etc.

We look forward to make this project an exhaustive study by focussing on one or more benchmark problems (like MNIST, to compare with existing optimisation methods), include ablative tests on hyper-parameters (like learning rate, a, b) and parameters, and thus compare how our proposed change fares with existing methods.
